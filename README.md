### Notes:
#### TODOS:
- Please frist read all the text then start your implementation.
- We want you to build an intersection, where some of the daily scenarios happens. Implicitly, followings scenarios should be covered: 
- Between color changes there should be 3 seconds wait time.
When east west lamp turns in to green then other lamps suddenly should turn into red no 3 seconds here.
- If south(G => Guney) lamp is green then at the same time north(K => Kuzey) lamp should also be in green state. And West(B => Bati) and East(D=> Dogu) lamps should be in red a this period of time.
- Same logic should be applied if west and east are green then south and north lambs should be in red.
- By color change you should have also yellow state in between read and green.
- If the green color is on, on any of the road than this road should have some background color. For west east use "choose your own" as background color on green. For south north use "choose your own" as background color on green.

- Optional : You dont have to implment cars! But if you like you can. And as optional bonus task: you can make also those arrows blinking while the green lamp is on.
- As conseptional thinking and aproach you can take a look this code just have and idea how you should structure your code:
